# Inventory-Management-System
We are building a generic inventory system, for our project, that could be used for any business. 
The system can be customized for, or by, a business to suit their specific type of inventory.
It can help to manage a businessâ€™ stock by keeping track of all inventory on hand,
the rate at which the inventory is reduced,and suggested dates to reorder new stock.
This allows the system to send alerts to warn of low inventory or reminders to place an order with a product vendor. 
Alerts can also be generated to warn of vendor changes such as price changes or new products added. 
The user can select specific inventory to generate an order to send out to product vendors and they can also generate reports with any pertinent information that the system stores about the inventory.
